        <p>
          The Pre-Colonial Era in the Philippines is a unique and fascinating part of our history, characterized by traits and traditions that still influence our society today.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          How was taxation conducted during the Pre-Colonial Era in the Philippines? There were various methods, one of which was the practice of barter. In this system, individuals would give crops, farm animals, or jewelries to the Datu, the head of the village.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Barter</h3>
        <p>
          In the barter system, taxation took different forms. People offered fees such as gold or jewelries to their Datu, creating a mutually beneficial situation and ensuring the safety of the barter. This practice was a response to the common occurrence of raids on other people’s belongings.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Tribute - Gifts</h3>
        <p>
          Another method of taxation involved people in the "Barangay" presenting gifts or tributes to their Datu during every harvest or special occasion. These gifts, ranging from handcrafted jewelries to farm animals and shiny objects (considered valuable), aimed to show appreciation and maintain the civility and safety of their community.

        <h2>Spanish Colonial Era</h2>
        <p>
          The Spanish Colonial Era in the Philippines is the longest colonial period, marked by both sorrowful events and inspirational ideas. Many traits prominent in our country's national heroes originated during this era as they fought for justice and freedom.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          During the 17th and 18th centuries in the Philippines, various taxes were collected from the people by the Spanish government. These included a head tax, taxes on jewelry and gold items, and indirect taxes on items like tobacco, wine, and even entertainment such as cockfights. Due to the poor financial condition of the country, Spain had to give an annual subsidy of P 250,000.00 from 1521 to 1821.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Different taxes existed, like tributo, originally around 8 to 10 reales, and forced labor known as polo y servicio. Spain later replaced tributo with something called cedula, a system that helped them keep track of who paid taxes. Land ownership given by the Crown, called encomienda, was another way Spain collected taxes. A part of the produce went to the government, and there was a tax for the local church too. Other local taxes included vinta, paid by people along the coast to defend against pirates, and donativo de Zamboanga, used specifically for conquering Jolo.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          During the Spanish era in the Philippines, these were different forms of taxes:
        </p>
  
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tributo (Encomienda tax):</strong> This tax was primarily an annual tribute or payment that people had to make to the government. It likely varied in amount and was collected as a form of contribution to the Spanish authorities.</li>
          <li><strong>Diezmos prediales (Government tax):</strong> This tax was based on agricultural or production output. Individuals had to give approximately 1/10 (diezmos means "tenths" in Spanish) of what they produced—such as crops or goods—to the government as a form of taxation.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>
          Here’s an example of a Filipino’s tax during the Spanish Era:
        </p>
  
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tributo:</strong> 10 reales</li>
          <li><strong>Diezmos prediales:</strong> 1 reales</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>American Era</h2>
    <div class="left-align-text">
      <p>
        The American Colonial Era is where taxation became a significant aspect. During this era, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) was implemented. The BIR is a government sector with the objective of accounting and collecting taxes from the people. These taxes are used to fund various sectors and projects for the community and the entire country.
      </p>

      <p>
        The BIR was created on August 1, 1904, by Henry Ide and Josh S. Hord, initially with 69 employees, including Collectors, Vice collectors, chief clerk, law clerk, and Division Chiefs. It had 8 divisions upon its creation, including Accounting, cash, records, license, Law, real estate, clerical, and inspection. After changes and mergers of government sectors in subsequent years, it consolidated into 5 divisions: Administrative, accounting, law, income tax, and inspection.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the American era, the use of Cedula was prevalent, serving as a residential certificate and used in tax collection. This certificate was given to individuals after reaching a certain age, mandating them to pay taxes. Despite revisions and changes in the BIR during the American era, some of its foundational aspects have persisted to the present day. This underscores the era's significant impact, as it laid the groundwork for the systems we have today. Without this foundation, societal struggles could have ensued, and those in power might have exploited it for personal gain.

      <h3>Post-War Era (1946-1986)</h3>
      <p>
        The Philippine tax system underwent significant changes in the post-war era. In 1946, the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) was enacted, which established the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) as the government agency responsible for administering the tax system. The NIRC was based on the US Internal Revenue Code, and it reflected the Philippines' close economic and political ties with the United States at the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The post-war era was also characterized by high tax rates. The marginal income tax rate for individuals was as high as 90% in the 1950s, and the corporate income tax rate was 40%. These high tax rates were necessary to finance the government's reconstruction efforts after World War II.

      <h3>Current Period (1986-Present)</h3>
      <p>
        In 1986, the Philippine tax system underwent a major reform with the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRAIN). The TRAIN simplified the tax system, reduced tax rates, and broadened the tax base. It also introduced a number of new taxes, such as the value-added tax (VAT) and the excise tax on alcohol and tobacco products.
      </p>

      <p>
        The TRAIN has been credited with boosting tax revenues and improving the efficiency of the tax system. However, the Philippines still has one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in Southeast Asia. This is due to a number of factors, including a large informal economy, tax evasion, and tax exemptions.
